\documentclass{IEEEtran}					%Everything is default, which is journal, 10pt font, and final draft
\usepackage{dtk-logos}						%This let me do the cool BibTeX logo, you shouldn't need this line. Add additional packages here:

\title{\vspace{2in}Smart Whiteboard Eraser}	%the \vspace is moving the title down from the top of the page

	\vspace{12pt} 								%I put in some space to get the due date listed a little lower

	\section{Introduction}
	Clearly state your project, and what is the main deliverable.  List your team members, and what their specific responsibilities will
	be in completing the project.  This section should have any details about your team member's strengths, but just very simply what
	their responsibilities are in about a sentence
	(i.e. Student One is responsible for being the project manager, micro-controller communications programming, 
	and design of PCB to interface with components).
	
	\section{Background}
	Brief statement of goals of the project and the objectives that will need to be accomplished to attain the goal.  Describe the background, strengths and weaknesses, of each
	team member's knowledge, as it pertains to the project.  Explain in detail what background information is going to need to be researched
	and learned to complete your project.  You should list specific courses that you have taken during your time at Fresno State that you will need to 
	use information from to complete your project.  Note, for a successful Senior Design Topic, you must be using a breadth of knowledge.
	
	\section{Project Description}
	Describe your project in detail in this section.  List out all of the major components, as well as all of the minor components underneath that.
	Explain all the major difficulties with the project.  Briefly describe the
	budget for your project, including major items you think will need to be purchased, if any.  It doesn't have to be very exact at this point, but you should
	have a ballpark figure for the major parts.
	Explain equipment you think you will need to use, be it purchased, already
	owned, or borrowed from the ECE department.  List who your technical faculty advisor is, what their area of expertise is, and how
	you will use that expertise in your project.
	
	\section*{References}
	You will use \BibTeX \hspace{1pt} to generate references for all of the material you cited, using \verb1\cite{}1, to write this report.
	Use the \verb1\bibliographystyle{IEEEtran}1 to generate your references.
