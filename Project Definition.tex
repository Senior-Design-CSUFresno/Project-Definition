%ECE 186A - Senior Design

%This is a template you can use for your Project Descriptions, though you will need to change a good portion of it for your own needs.

\documentclass{IEEEtran}						%Everything is default, which is journal, 10pt font, and final draft

\usepackage{dtk-logos}						%This let me do the cool BibTeX logo, you shouldn't need this line.
%add additional packages here:

\title{\vspace{2in}Project Description Instructions}	%the \vspace is moving the title down from the top of the page
\author{ECE 186A - Senior Design I \\ 			%I am jamming all of the stuff I want on the title page into the Author spot, I know, this isn't elegant
	Fall 2018 - Dr. Stillmaker \\ 					%Note the \\ line returns to make sure to put each one on a new line
	\vspace{12pt} 								%I put in some space to get the due date listed a little lower
	\textbf{Due:} Friday, September 28, 2018 by 10:00 AM to Blackboard \\ 
	\vspace{2in}								%You may need to mess with this space, this space is above the signature lines.
	%\underline{\hspace{3in}} \\
	%\textbf{Project Manager:} Student One}			%Uncomment this section and fill in your team names and your technical advisor's name.

	\vspace{4in}}								%You will need to mess with this space, this space is after the signature lines.  The idea
%is to make the title page by itself.  I know, this isn't elegant either, but IEEE formatting doesn't
%make title pages

\begin{document}
	\thispagestyle{empty}						%This removes the page number from the title page.
	
	\maketitle									%This generates the title from the information given above.
	
	\IEEEPARstart{Y}{ou} 						%This makes the cool looking formatting for the first word.  It isn't required.
	and your team should generate a single PDF document using \LaTeX \hspace{1pt} and the \verb1\documentclass{IEEEtran}1.
	You are welcome to use the posted \verb1ProjectDescriptionInstructions.tex1 file posted on Blackboard, and just modify that to add your
	own information, and meet the requirements.
	I don't want to give a definite page limit, but I am expecting this document to be somewhere around three to five pages, though making sure to 
	adequately cover all the requested
	material is what matters.  In other words, I expect that at this point you have rather thoroughly thought through your project, and should
	have a lot to say about it.
	
	It should contain the following parts:
	
	\section*{Title Page}
	Your title page should include your project's name, ECE 186A, the date, and all of your ECE group member's names.
	It should also include the signature of your technical faculty advisor, as well as all of the members of your ECE group.
	To accomplish this you should use the \verb1\maketitle1 command, and likely will need to add some \verb1\vspace{}1
	and then the signature lines, which you can see in the example I gave in Lecture 5.  After this, you will need to add more space
	to make sure it is only the above mentioned information that was included.  Unfortunately we can't just use the \verb1\newpage1
	command, because the IEEEtran Journal format doesn't have the ability to make a title page, so you are welcome to figure out
	another way, or use my somewhat inelegant workaround solution.
	
	\section{Introduction}
	Clearly state your project, and what is the main deliverable.  List your team members, and what their specific responsibilities will
	be in completing the project.  This section should have any details about your team member's strengths, but just very simply what
	their responsibilities are in about a sentence
	(i.e. Student One is responsible for being the project manager, micro-controller communications programming, 
	and design of PCB to interface with components).
	
	\section{Background}
	Brief statement of goals of the project and the objectives that will need to be accomplished to attain the goal.  Describe the background, strengths and weaknesses, of each
	team member's knowledge, as it pertains to the project.  Explain in detail what background information is going to need to be researched
	and learned to complete your project.  You should list specific courses that you have taken during your time at Fresno State that you will need to 
	use information from to complete your project.  Note, for a successful Senior Design Topic, you must be using a breadth of knowledge.
	
	\section{Project Description}
	Describe your project in detail in this section.  List out all of the major components, as well as all of the minor components underneath that.
	Explain all the major difficulties with the project.  Briefly describe the
	budget for your project, including major items you think will need to be purchased, if any.  It doesn't have to be very exact at this point, but you should
	have a ballpark figure for the major parts.
	Explain equipment you think you will need to use, be it purchased, already
	owned, or borrowed from the ECE department.  List who your technical faculty advisor is, what their area of expertise is, and how
	you will use that expertise in your project.
	
	\section*{References}
	You will use \BibTeX \hspace{1pt} to generate references for all of the material you cited, using \verb1\cite{}1, to write this report.
	Use the \verb1\bibliographystyle{IEEEtran}1 to generate your references.
